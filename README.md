# bias-analyse
No single bias metric provides a complete picture of “fairness”; you will almost always need to report several and understand the trade-offs. We explore whether a structured approach can be developed to calculate bias and fairness metrics given the dataset.

# Functianal
in [main.ipynb](https://github.com/bytnater/bias-analyse/blob/main/main.ipynb) you can select test you the fairness of your prediction given the dataset.

You may also save the selected parameters in a file to use it later and switch between tests.
